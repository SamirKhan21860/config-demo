// What is Iterators and Genertor Functions?
// ans: Iterators and Generators bring the concept of iteration directly into core language and provide a mechanism for customizing the behavior of for...of loops.
// YIELD Keyword?
// for...of loop

function makeDirectorFunction(start, end = Infinity, steps) {
    let 
  }
  
  // Built-In for...of loop
  for (const value of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) {
    console.log(value); // for of loop have built in iterator function(method) which tells the for...of loop to 
    // iterate the array in sequence if you have given to iterate the Array.
  }

// Why need to learn iterators and generators? i.e function*, yeild, 
// ans: Iterators and generator are used to make custom loops like for...loop to iterrate the custom data structures
// which you've created (for project you working on or in team, company) such as: Trees, Linked list etc. Now to 
// iterate over these data structures you'll need your custom iterators and generators function to achive the specific outcome.
